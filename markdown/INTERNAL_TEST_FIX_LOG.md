# K歌助手 Internal Test Fix Log

> Source: `C:\Users\bradw\Downloads\ktv_webapp_internal_test_issues.md`  
> Purpose: track the first internal-test issue batch through implementation, verification, commits, push, and redeploy.

## Issue Inventory

| ID | Priority | Area | Issue | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IT-01 | P0 | Mobile queue | Add a visible `切歌 / 下一首` control that skips the current song and syncs playback state. | Done |
| IT-02 | P0 | Mobile queue | Add a `重唱` control that restarts the current song without changing queue order. | Done |
| IT-03 | P0 | Home page | Make portrait mobile layout clearly show `创建房间` and `扫码点歌`, while making intro panels look non-clickable. | Done |
| IT-04 | P1 | Search | Add `带原唱` toggle; default off; use it in search query/ranking. | Done |
| IT-05 | P1 | Search | Add `歌名 / 歌手` search type selector; default song-title mode. | Done |
| IT-06 | P0 | Mobile search | Do not auto-switch to the queue after adding a song; keep search context and show success feedback. | Done |
| IT-07 | P0 | Search preview | Only one preview may play at once; clicking preview/card selects the result. | Done |
| IT-08 | P1 | Search results | Support loading more results from the current cached result set, not new API calls. | Done |
| IT-09 | P1 | Search state | Persist query, type, original-vocal toggle, result cache, visible count, selected video, and scroll position. | Done |
| IT-10 | P2 | Search quality | Improve filtering/ranking for song-title vs artist searches and KTV/original-vocal intent. | Done |
