## Issue Inventory

| ID | Priority | Area | Request | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PIT-01 | P1 | Mobile search cards | Move `已选中` / `已在歌单` into overlay pill tags so card content does not shift. | Done |
| PIT-02 | P0 | Search ranking | Restore KTV/karaoke versions as top priority, then accompaniment/lyrics video, while still respecting original-vocal intent. | Done |
| PIT-03 | P1 | Mobile preview | Remove redundant preview buttons; selecting a result should auto-preview it. | Done |
| PIT-04 | P1 | Create page | Remove the `扫码点歌` button from the create-room page because no room exists yet. | Done |
| PIT-05 | P1 | Add-song feedback | Replace per-card notification with a page-level toast and a visual flight animation into the queue/count area. | Done |
| PIT-06 | P1 | Mobile queue count | Show the current song-list count in the queue tab/header count area. | Done |
| PIT-07 | P1 | Mobile search controls | Convert `带原唱` from checkbox to pill toggle; put type, query, toggle, and icon-only search button on one compact row. | Done |
| PIT-08 | P1 | Mobile search controls | Keep search controls and visible-result count sticky while scrolling results. | Done |
| PIT-09 | P1 | Mobile preview | Hide removable YouTube preview chrome and stop preview when the user clicks away. | Done |

| PIT-11 | P1 | Display player | Keep a useful progress/seek control after hiding YouTube controls. | Done |
| PIT-12 | P1 | Display quality | Keep the app quality selector authoritative and avoid mismatched YouTube quality chrome. | Done |
| PIT-13 | P0 | Room lifecycle | Auto-clean inactive rooms after 5 minutes without activity. | Done |
| PIT-14 | P0 | Room heartbeat | Treat open display/mobile pages as active by sending/receiving periodic heartbeats. | Done |
